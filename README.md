# Status Effect Timer

This is a Minecraft mod that overlays a timer on the Vanilla status effect HUD icons.

I created this since the vanilla user experience of going into the inventory, and closing the recipe book, to check the remaining time of status effects was not ... ideal.
There are some other mods that tried to achieve this, but most are bloated replacement for large parts of vanilla code. 

This is a very minimalistic mod. No settings are required nor provided.

This mod requires Minecraft 1.16.5 and the Fabric loader.

## Download

Download locations coming soon.

## Installation

Install this as you would any other Fabric mod. (Personally, I recommend MultiMC as Minecraft launcher for modded Minecraft.)

## Support

Do you have any problems with the mod? Please open an issue here on Github.

Currently only Minecraft 1.16.5 is supported, but it would probably be trivial to add support for other versions. 
If you want support for another versin, please open an issue and state the requested version.
